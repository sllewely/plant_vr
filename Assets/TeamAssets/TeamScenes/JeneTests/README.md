-Created a Master Scene folder, with my environment. Please build in this!
-Scaled up/rearranged flowerbed so all grabbing can take place in this area
-All objects in flower + floor/house are now static meshes with colliders
-updated geometry on flowerpots so they're smoother

7/27
-Beetle_still in prefabs
-Beetle_walk in prefabs
@Sarah this isn't set up in the typical way an animation should be done, so for now, 
maybe just use the beetle walk prefab instead of trying to call one or the other
-Moved scene over to be more centered around 0,0,0


7/26
-New Prefab: heartleaf alive and dead states
-Deleted "SceneScale" scene
-UI for Score placed in background, by fence
