Uploaded the adjusted beetle height (the one used at PlayNYC)
Scaled down flower bed
Moved around objects which were mostly out of sight to be more visible

8/9
Wasp_anim prefab in Prefabs/Enemies
Tried to adjust collider on dirt, but beetles still falling through when thrown
Moved Enemy spawner closer to use and lowered it so beetles aren't floating
Master Scene is crashing after about 10 sec when playing. Starts to strobe and Open VR shuts down.

7/28
-Created a Master Scene folder, with my environment. Please build in this!
-Scaled up/rearranged flowerbed so all grabbing can take place in this area
-All objects in flower + floor/house are now static meshes with colliders
-updated geometry on flowerpots so they're smoother

7/27
-Beetle_still in prefabs
-Beetle_walk in prefabs
@Sarah this isn't set up in the typical way an animation should be done, so for now, 
maybe just use the beetle walk prefab instead of trying to call one or the other
-Moved scene over to be more centered around 0,0,0


7/26
-New Prefab: heartleaf alive and dead states
-Deleted "SceneScale" scene
-UI for Score placed in background, by fence
